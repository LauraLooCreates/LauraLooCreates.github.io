            Incense and Smoke
        </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">
            C Incense and Am Smoke<br>
            Fill the Em Space where no one Am Spoke<br>
            I can G Hear the sli F ence way too C<br>
            <br>
            Em Handshakes and Am jokes<br>
            Fade away Em like the smoke Am<br>
            That i Gm breathed in from you Dm<br>
            Between the Am crowds and the C pews<br>
            <br>

            A third wheel Em and a car Am<br>
            Take me a Em little less far Am<br>
            From a heart Am Oh I know G is behind those walls C<br>
            <br>
            Heartbreaks G and Am drumsolos<br>
            You taught me to Dm feel<br>
            The beat Am of that part F<br>
            Sometimes Em brings me to C tears<br>
            <br>

            Fill the Spcae where no one spoke<br>
            Fill the crowds and the pews<br>
            Hearts need something to hold them together<br>
            How can I hold together<br>
            Without you?<br>
            <br>
            Handshakes and jokes<br>
            Fade away like the smoke<br>
            That i breathed in from you<br>
            Between the crowds and the pews<br>
            <br>
            A third wheel and a car<br>
            Take me a little less far<br>
            From a drumset<br>
            I know<br>
            Is behind those walls<br>
            <br>
            Concerts and drum solos<br>
            You taught me to hear<br>
            The beat of a heart<br>
            This beat that sometimes brings me to tears<br>

            Hypocritical
        </h3>
        <p style="font-size: 10px;">
                Im just picky<br>
                With the people<br>
                In the places<br>
                I hang around<br>
<br>
                Doesnt it seem hypocritical<br>
                He coaches me<br>
                On why I should leave<br>
                About the difficulty<br>
                Of a girl like me<br>
                Loving<br>
                A bou who smokes weed<br>
<br>
                Then falls in love<br>
                With the fulfillment of his dreams<br>
                The day after I cut all strings<br>
<br>
                I come out crying<br>
                I am so sad<br>
                Will, his response,<br>
                Who is that? <br>
<br>
                His name I suppose<br>
                Means nothing to those<br>
                Other than me<br>
                Does his name attach<br>
                The songs<br>
                And Flashbacks<br>
                To a boy whos heart holds the one he <br>
                Wants, loves, and needs<br>
<br>
                This heart<br>
                Break happened silently<br>
                Behind a door<br>
                Between two loves<br>
                Who could want<br>
                Nothing more<br>
<br>
                This fear piled unknowingly<br>
                With each look over my shoulder<br>
                This fear<br>
                I am afraid<br>
                Makes me act a bit<br>
                Older<br>
<br>
                This fear attaches itself<br>
                To the <br>
                Ordinary<br>
                Blushing at brusselsprouts<br>
                Calling their looks
                Scary<br>
<br>
                This fear<br>
                I hope<br>
                Was not the reason<br>
                For all this cut rope<br>
                Not the<br>
                Projectory<br>
                Of my loves<br>
                The reason for my gloves<br>
<br>
                This fear<br>
                Cannot grow<br>
                Cannot grow in the snow<br>
<br>
                Do i run from the fear<br>
                Or is it what I hold near<br>
                That keeps these gates<br>
                Locked shut<br>
                Keeps my sight unclear<br>
<br>
                The rhythm and the beat<br>
                Cannot decide<br>
                If they should land on the bass<br>
                Or stick on the high<br>

    <h3>Candles</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">
            Sitting around candles<br>
            That I will never light<br>
            I dont want it in my air<br>
            But still I love the sight<br>
<br>
            Slippping through my fingers<br>
            Should I hold on<br>
            To something that is not mine<br>
            Could that really be so wrong<br>
<br>
            What is ours<br>
            The flame or the fingers?<br>
            The memory of the pain<br>
            The knowledge of the hurt<br>
<br>
            If what we hold<br>
            Is not held<br>
            By our own property<br>
            Can there be justification for the “for sale” sign<br>
            We put up, hoping others see<br>
<br>
            What is not ours<br>
            Cannot be given<br>
            For we think inside these walls<br>
            That shape the light from heaven<br>
<br>
            Selling, marketing, planning<br>
            To gather catch and produce<br>
            A love that she sees all of her friends<br>
            All of her friends fall into<br>
<br>
            Surround yourself<br>
            With candles<br>
            Of the same scent<br>
            You will begin to wonder<br>
            Why the air is, breaking itself in<br>
<br>
            But my nose and my eyes<br>
            Cannot take the smell or the sight<br>
            Or a hand whos holding on so tight<br>
<br>
            That is not mine<br>
            Cannot take the smell<br>
            Or the light<br>
            Lit by the hand of someone<br>
            Who justifies<br>
            That the hand is theirs<br>
            Or they created the light<br>
<br>
            “Get out of my way”<br>
            “Sorry for going there”<br>
            Exposes the belief<br>
            Of ownership over the air<br>
<br>
            My hand is not mine<br>
            That lights the wick in the night<br>
            Or holds the hand of a child<br>
            Oh so tight<br>
<br>
            The lungs that breathe<br>
            Those scents of love so deep<br>
            Are not my own<br>
            I would not light it<br>
            Even in the cold<br>
            While I am feeling alone<br>
<br>
            The scent, the air, the lungs, or chairs,<br>
            The beat, our muscles<br>
            There is no need to hustle<br>
<br>
            Hold or be held<br>
            Gifts in gift's hands<br>
            No work no money no food<br>
            No plan<br>
<br>
            These things won't give you ownership<br>
            Ownership of the land<br>
            Will the heart<br>
            Or a boys hand<br>

            To give his forever<br>
            Is to light the wick<br>
            Of a candle<br>
            That is not mine<br>
            A candle I am not ready to breathe in<br>
<br>
            No work no monye no food no plan will<br>
            Give you ownership of the land<br>
<br>
            No look, no love, no time youve spent<br>
            Will open his heart, will let you in<br>
<br>
            Look no further<br>
            Just under your feet<br>
            For You might miss<br>
            A penny dropped for you<br>
            Miss<br>
<br>
